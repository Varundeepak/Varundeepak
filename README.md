# Hi there, I'm Varundeepak 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an MSc Data Science Graduate and an Enthusiast passionate about data analysis, data visualisation, and machine learning. This space has some of my projects ranging from sentiment analysis and churn prediction to interactive dashboards.

## About Me
I have received my MSc in Data Science degree from The University of Edinburgh, UK (super proud of myself!) I enjoy exploring datasets, building predictive models and visualising insights. My work spans classic ML techniques, deep learning models and business intelligence tools like Tableau and Qlik Sense. I'm constantly learning and love working on interesting problems. Check out my [portfolio](https://admirable-granita-59c01c.netlify.app/) and my [resume](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Varundeepak/blob/main/VarundeepakIndiaResume.pdf)!

## Projects & Highlights
- [**Rossmann Sales Forecasting**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/time-series-rossman) - Built time series forecasting models on the Rossmann Store Sales dataset to predict weekly sales and uncover business insights. After cleaning and exploring the data, benchmarked **ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet** models. SARIMA achieved the best accuracy (RMSE ~184, RMSPE ~4%), while Prophet provided a competitive accuracy with interpretable components (trend decline, weekend peaks, December spikes, promo uplift of ~40%)

- [**Sentiment Analysis Web App**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/huggingface-amazon-review-sentiment-analysis) - Built a web application for analysing Amazon product reviews using a pre‑trained RoBERTa model. The app supports single review inputs and CSV uploads, providing predictions with confidence scores and downloadable results. Developed with Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, pandas and Gradio.

- [**Customer Churn Prediction**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Churn-Prediction-ML) - Analysed the Telco Customer Churn dataset and built ML models to predict churn. After cleaning, feature engineering and exploratory analysis, logistic regression achieved ~80 % accuracy and 0.836 ROC‑AUC. Insights included higher churn among month‑to‑month customers and those with higher charges.

- [**Superstore Sales Dashboard (Tableau)**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Sample-SuperStore-DataSet-Tableau) - Created an interactive dashboard using the Sample Superstore dataset. Features include profit maps, KPI cards, sales by category/sub‑category and filters by region, segment and category.

- [**Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Global-CO2-Emissions-Tableau) - Analysed the Our World in Data CO₂ dataset (2000‑2023) and built visualisations in Tableau to explore emissions, energy use and economic output across countries.

- **Spotify Score Prediction** - Given the parameters of a song like the artists, danceability, loudness, etc., the ML model would predict what score the song would achieve on the given date or week with more than 90% accuracy. (I haven't included this in GitHub since it was a coursework assessment during my master's)

- [**Road Safety & Accident Patterns (Qlik Sense)**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Qlik-VIP-Road-Safety-and-Accident-Patterns) - Developed Qlik Sense dashboards to explore road safety and accident patterns in India. The dashboards examine causes, severity and high‑risk regions and include demonstration videos.

- [**Library Management System**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Mini-Project-1) - Designed a Java application to manage library members, books, stock and due dates. The system automatically sends SMS reminders before the due date and notifies members when new books are added.

- [**Twitter & Meme Sentiment Analysis (Mini Project 2)**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Mini-Project-2-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis) - Implemented scripts to determine tweet polarity using classical NLP techniques and a CNN model for meme sentiment analysis. Provided standalone Python scripts and an Android app to collect tweets; the CNN model is shared via Google Drive.

- [**Android Sentiment Analysis App**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/TwitterSentimentAnalysisAndroidApplication) - Built an Android application (Java) that connects to the sentiment analysis backend to classify tweets on the go.

- [**Breast Cancer Prediction**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/Breast-Cancer-Prediction---SmartBridge-Summer-Intern-Project) - Explored the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset during a SmartBridge internship. The notebook applies ML models to classify tumours and includes a final report and a Node‑RED flow for deployment.

- [**Movie Recommendations**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/analyzing-movie-dataset) - Wrote a simple Python script to explore a movie dataset and suggest high‑rated films. This project helped me practise list operations and basic data handling.

- [**GreyAtom Python for Data Science Projects**](https://github.com/Varundeepak/greyatom-python-for-data-science) - Completed a series of mini‑projects as part of the GreyAtom program covering Python fundamentals, OOP, NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib.
